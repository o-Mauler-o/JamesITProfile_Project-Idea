    <h2 class="leader">Cyber-Warfare Prevention Software</h2>
</center>
	</br>
<section>
<div class="first"><h2 class="leader">Overview</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the 21st Century, a new form of warfare was discovered - Cyber Warfare. Through the globalization of the globe with the assistance of technology, more and more nations are depending on digital infrastructure for all their needs, from basic living standards, to luxury goods, consumer goods, and the like. However, through the dependency, reveals a whole new vulnerability that Cyber-Warfare can target to catastrophic effect. A well placed hack could disable a power station, leaving most of a metropolitan district without power until the situation is resolved. This could take hours, days or even weeks depending on how advanced the affected target is. Some nations in the world are pioneers on Offensive Cyber-Warfare, while some are more defensive specialists in Cyber-Warfare. In protecting one’s nation from a Cyber attack, one can go about the defense a few ways. They could be a reactionary, where they react to attacks as they come in, and either lock them (the attackers) out before they can do damage, or fix any damage that is done after the attack is complete. Another way is to develop software that could adapt to any attack made, which can be done multiple ways. The first way is to input several hacking methods into an algorithm, and then from that, the algorithm can determine an appropriate response to the hack. This is limited by hacking methods that have actually been tried and used. Alternatively, one could set up a software that scans and adapts to hacks while they happen, so that it can determine on the fly how it's occurring and ways to overcome it.</p></div>

<div class="first"><h2 class="leader">Motivation</h2>
<p>Since the start of 2021, RMIT University has suffered 2 Cyber-Attacks on its system(s) and database(s). These attacks, like many other attempted attacks on Australian Digital infrastructure threaten to reveal information about certain subjects/topics, including personal information, national information, etc. If an attack was to breach our cyber-defense systems, it would spell catastrophe for whoever was breached. This, obviously isn’t on, and thus, certain steps should be taken to improve/rework/upgrade existing Cyber Security programs, or make new ones that will plug the gaps. That is in fact, my very intention with this project idea…
</p></div>
</aside>
<section>
<div class="first"><h2 class="leader">Description</h2>
<p>To make an adaptive cyber security program that detects, scans and adapts to breaches into its firewall while they are occurring, so that no critical information/intelligence is leaked and revealed to the hacking party. At the launch of the new system, an algorithm can run through all hacking methods, tools and styles used previously, analyze them, and create a database to refer to in the event of a breach. Then, when a breach were to occur, the program would analyze the hack style and compare it to the database and formulate an appropriate response to counter and neutralize the hack. In my very limited experience in Cyber Security, something like this is notably Sci-Fi, something like how the Borg (from Star Trek) adapt to any attacks made against them, so that the first attack does damage, but the second attack does nothing. But the 21st Century is all about innovation, and that technology is just as easily around the corner as decades away. The Specifics of the Program is that the more resources it has access to to use in its database, the more likely it is to counter any attempted breach. A program such as this easily has both Civilian and Military applications, and, if it ends up being feasible, will allow for adaptive systems of other types to also function.</p>

<p>A product such as this would be quite expensive, and the technology required for an adaptive system that functions perfectly doesn’t quite exist yet, but if worked, it would fund itself in no time, and would lead the Cyber-Defense market for a while, but that’s a BIG if. However, this project would build up over time. For now, something small would be made, something to counter test-breaches/obstacles. Once the program is ready, the more and more information is inputted into it and/or the database it refers to, the more likely it is to counter a hack/obstacle, and it continues on, adapting and adapting, like a domino. But like a virus, where a virus will adapt to new medicines as they roll out, hackers will use new methods to breach, and the program will analyze those new methods and adapt, so instead of one side being able to hack everything instantly and easily, or the other side being entirely impregnable, both sides would keep adapting off each other.</p>

<p>At the start, the program would cater to smaller organisations, companies and the like, gathering information and experience, and the end product would be catering to governments and Militaries. The end product is FAR in the future, and far outside the capabilities that I currently possess, would require a tonne of resources, and personnel to maintain it, but at its beginning, it could be an entirely 1-5 man team with minimal to no funding.

<div class="first"><h2 class="leader">Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>A Project such as this, would require extensive resources, for this is a large scale project, that is desperately needed, both for corporations but militaries, and national entities. In theory, all technology required for an Adaptive system such as this exists. In practice, however, it is a completely different matter. Essentially, an algorithm would be created, that would be as follows.</p>

<p>This is really rough, and from an untrained mind in the aspects of cyber-warfare. But essentially, you’d make sure the program is able to identify and compare hacks both past and present. If a hack is occurring presently, but a similar (or identical) hack occurred in the past which was logged and recorded, one could study the previous hack on how it was able to hack, and then counter it. Obviously this would be slow, if it was a person doing it, but if it was a program, one backed up a server bank, to keep processing speeds high, it would be able to scan the database and compare the hacks to find out to counter-hack it.</p></div>

<section>
<div class="first"><h2 class="leader">Skills Required</h2>
<p>In order to pull something like this off, a basic understanding of cyber-security would be sufficient, for as the longer the program is operational, the more it learns and the more it’s able to counter the issues in front of it. An understanding of programming, enough so as to actually write up an algorithm/program to start off the project would be required. As the development of the program continued, so too would the skills required for the project to increase to match. On top of this, as the program grows, the team would grow in size to support it, distributing the required skills out to allow specialised personnel to assist, rather than Jacks-of-all-trades.</p></div>
</section>
<section>
<div class="first"><h2 class="leader">Outcome</h2>
<p>If this project is successful, the security of the environments it is deployed in would increase dramatically, if it becomes successful after the initial start-up, its success would only continue to grow with the project, with the end product enabling a government (i.e Australia) becoming almost entire secure from any/all cyber attacks in the future and beyond. The applications of an adaptive algorithm would also be staggering and currently incomprehensible and could apply to a number of different backgrounds.
